# 🚀 Netlify Deployment Guide - HTML Version

## ✅ Problem Solved!

Your website was downloading files because you uploaded **PHP files** to **Netlify**, which only supports static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). 

I've converted all your PHP files to HTML files that will work perfectly on Netlify!

## 📁 Files Ready for Deployment

### HTML Files (Upload These):
- `index.html` - Homepage
- `client-portal.html` - Client Portal
- `market.html` - Market Page  
- `contact.html` - Contact Page
- `prop-firm.html` - Prop Firm Page
- `biodegradable-packaging.html` - Eco Solutions Page (New!)

### Supporting Files:
- `style.css` - Main styles
- `portal-styles.css` - Portal styles
- `market-styles.css` - Market styles
- `contact-styles.css` - Contact styles
- `prop-firm-styles.css` - Prop firm styles
- `script.js` - Main JavaScript
- `portal-script.js` - Portal JavaScript
- `market-script.js` - Market JavaScript
- `contact-script.js` - Contact JavaScript
- `prop-firm-script.js` - Prop firm JavaScript
- `images/` folder with your logo and photos

## 🚀 Deploy to Netlify (Updated Steps)

### Method 1: Drag & Drop (Easiest)
1. **Select these files and folders:**
   - All `.html` files
   - All `.css` files  
   - All `.js` files
   - `images/` folder
   
2. **Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)**
3. **Drag and drop** the selected files to the deploy area
4. **Your site will be live instantly!**

### Method 2: Zip Upload
1. **Create a new folder** called `aurum-fx-website`
2. **Copy these files into it:**
   - All `.html` files
   - All `.css` files
   - All `.js` files
   - `images/` folder
3. **Zip the folder**

## ⚠️ Important: Don't Upload PHP Files

**DO NOT upload these files to Netlify:**
- `*.php` files (index.php, contact.php, etc.)
- `functions.php`

These will cause the download issue you experienced.
